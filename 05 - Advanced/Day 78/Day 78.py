# 100 Days of Code: Python
# June 28, 2022
# Data science with Python
# Using Jupyter notebooks online via Anaconda

# Learning points
# How to uncover and investigate NaN values.

# How to convert objects and string data types to numbers.

# Creating donut and bar charts with plotly.

# Create a rolling average to smooth out time-series data and show a trend.

# How to use .value_counts(), .groupby(), .merge(), .sort_values() and .agg().


# In addition, we learned many new things too. We looked at how to:

# Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.

# Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.

# Create Sunburst charts with plotly.

# Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.

# Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).

# See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
