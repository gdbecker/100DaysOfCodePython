# 100 Days of Code: Python
# June 24, 2022
# Data science with Python
# Using Jupyter notebooks online via Anaconda

# Learning points
# used .groupby() to explore the number of posts and entries per programming language

# converted strings to Datetime objects with to_datetime() for easier plotting

# reshaped our DataFrame by converting categories to columns using .pivot()

# used .count() and isna().values.any() to look for NaN values in our DataFrame, which we then replaced using .fillna()

# created (multiple) line charts using .plot() with a for-loop

# styled our charts by changing the size, the labels, and the upper and lower bounds of our axis.

# added a legend to tell apart which line is which by colour

# smoothed out our time-series observations with .rolling().mean() and plotted them to better identify trends over time.
