# Data science with Python
# Using Jupyter notebooks online via Anaconda

# Learning points
# Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

# Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

# Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

# Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

# Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

# Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

# Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

# Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
