# 100 Days of Code: Python - Project Portfolio

This is a collection of projects I made through the [100 Days of Code: Python course from Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Almost 100 projects are housed here that cover a variety of topics such as console-based scripting, games and other GUI applications, data science analysis, automation, API connectivity and web application development. I had a lot of fun solidifying my Python skills with all of these projects, and learned so much by diving into this 100 day coding challenge. Take a look and explore my showcase site to interact with live demos of my work and more details about each project!
