# 039-040 - Flight Deal Finder

Project goal from the course was to take a list of flights you want to search flights for and be notified when the prices are cheaper to buy. Unfortunately I was not able to finish due to the lack of free APIs to use, but the code here is a good base to work from for using a paid API source.
