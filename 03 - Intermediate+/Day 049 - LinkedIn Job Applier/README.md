# 049 - LinkedIn Job Applier

Project goal from the course was to automate applying for jobs on LinkedIn, practicing by using a fake job posting from The AppBrewery. Unfortunately when I started this project the job posting disappeared, and there were issues using Selenium to select the right elements on the page. I replaced Day 049's project with "Great Teacher".
